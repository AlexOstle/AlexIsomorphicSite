# Alex's Isomorphic Site #

A personal website used to show development and learning of current technologies, showcasing an attitude of exploration in the area of software engineering.

## Requirements ## 
* Must be easily maintainable by one person.
* Development must be simple due to lack of JS practice.
* Development should have quick turnaround time to keep motivation high.
* Focus on making a smaller, quality app, no desire to scale to many users.
* Lightweight over premium features.

## Rationale ##
Choosing a framework, the goal is to pick something lightweight and simple. Ideally, use of an isomorphic framework would allow for simple development. Using a full stack development could work if a lightweight simple stack was chosen like petitefire.
In short, the choice of framework is between an isomorphic framework, or a lightweight full-stack. It was chosen that an isomorphic framework would be best for this, as the trade-off is heavily a simplified, but powerful structure for both back and front end, in exchange for less customiseability.

Choosing an isomorphic framework was investigated, and it was quickly decided that Meteor was the optimal first choice. Meteor has a solid reputation as being the most notable isomorphic framework and is widely used today.

Another choice for development was the use of svelte for JavaScript implementation. Svelte seems to be highly rated in the software development community for building lightweight, fast components. Also noted is that there is plenty of tutorials online for the use of Svelte, and even a video playlist implementing Svelte and Meteor together, which can be used for guidance at different points of building the website, although note that the goal is not to recreate another project, instead learn through building.
